Merecat âˆ´ Embedded Web Server
=============================
[![License Badge][]][License] [![Travis Status][]][Travis]

<img align="right" width="500" src="www/img/merecat.jpg">

[Merecat][] started out as a pun at [Mongoose][], but is now useful for
actual web serving purposes.  It is however not a real [Meerkat][],
merely yet another copycat, forked from the great [thttpd][] created by
Jef&nbsp;Poskanzer.

Merecat expands a lot on the features originally offered by thttpd, but
still has a very limited feature set:

- Virtual hosts
- Basic `.htpasswd` and `.htaccess` support
- URL-traffic-based throttling
- CGI/1.1
- HTTP/1.1 Keep-alive
- Built-in gzip deflate using zlib
- HTTPS support using OpenSSL/LibreSSL

The resulting footprint (~100 kiB) makes it quick and suitable for small
and embedded systems, even those smaller than a Raspberry Pi!

Merecat is available as free/open source software under the simplified
2-clause [BSD license][license].  For more information, see the manual
page `merecat(8)`, or the [FAQ][].


Docker
------

Try out [Docker Merecat](https://hub.docker.com/r/troglobit/merecat/)
safely isolated from the rest of the system, with easy deployment.


Authentication
--------------

To protect a directory in your `~USERNAME/public_html/`, create the file
`.htpasswd` using the included `htpasswd` tool:

```shell
user@example:~/> cd public_html/Downloads
user@example:~/public_html/Downloads/> htpasswd -c .htpasswd friend
Changing password for user friend
New password: *****
Re-type new password: *****
```

Enable this feature, and user home directories, with the `configure`
script.  See more on this in the [Features](#features) section below.


Virtual Hosts
-------------

Setting up virtual hosts on a server can be a bit of a hassle with other
web servers.  With Merecat you simply create directories for each host
in the web server root:

```
/var/www/
  |-- icons/
  |-- cgi-bin/
  |-- errors/
  |    `-- err404.html
  |-- ftp.example.com/
   `- www.example.com/
```

Edit `/etc/merecat.conf`:

```conf
virtual-host = true
cgi-pattern = /cgi-bin/*|**.cgi
```

Now the web server root, `/var/www/`, no longer serves files, only
virtual host directories do, execpt for the shared files in `icons/`,
`cgi-bin/`, and `errors/`.

On Linux bind mounts can be used to set up FTP and web access to the
same files. Example `/etc/fstab`:

```
/srv/ftp  /var/www/ftp.example.com  none  defaults,bind  0  0
```


Optimizing Performance
----------------------

There are many tricks to optimizing the performance of your web server.
One of the most important ones is browser caching.  Merecat supports
both `ETag:` and `Cache-Control:`, however to enable the latter you need
to define the `max-age` setting in `/etc/merecat.conf`:

```conf
max-age = 3600        # One hour
```

The value is completely site dependent.  For an embedded system you
might want to set it to the maximum value, whereas for other scenarios
you will likely want something else.  By default this is disabled (0).

Another trick is to employ `gzip` compression.  Merecat has built-in
support for serving HTML, CSS, and other `text/*` files if there is a
`.gz` version of the same file.  Here is an example of how to compress
relevant files:

```shell
root@example:~/> cd /var/www/
root@example:/var/www/> for file in `find . -name '*.html' -o -name '*.css'`; do \
      gzip -c $file > $file.gz; done
```

This approach is more CPU friendly than letting Merecat "deflate" files
on the fly, which it otherwise does.


HTTPS Support
-------------

If the `configure` script finds OpenSSL installed HTTPS support will be
enabled by default, this can be disabled using `--without-ssl`.

The HTTPS support has SSLv2, SSLv3, and TLSv1 disabled (hard coded) by
default.  Only TLSv2 and later will be enabled and negotiated on a per
client basis.

To set up Merecat for HTTPS the following `/etc/merecat.conf` settings
must be enabled:

```
port     = 443
ssl      = true
certfile = certs/cert.pem
keyfile  = private/key.pem
```

To create a self signed certificate, use `openssl` like this:

```
root@example:/var/www/> mkdir private certs
root@example:/var/www/> openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 \
    -keyout private/key.pem -out certs/cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

**NOTE:** Currently, virtual hosts is not supported when HTTPS is
  enabled.  A wildcard certificate may work, but the author has not
  tested any of this yet pending *Let's Encrypt* support.


Build Requirements
------------------

Merecat depends on a few external libraries, if enabled, e.g. OpenSSL,
zlib, and [libConfuse](https://github.com/martinh/libconfuse/) which,
when built from source, defaults to an install prefix of `/usr/local`.
Non Debian/Ubuntu systems rarely support this GNU standard, so here is
how you reference it for the Merecat `configure` script:

```shell
user@example:~/merecat/> PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ./configure
```

To build Merecat without support for `/etc/merecat.conf`:

```shell
user@example:~/merecat/> ./configure --without-config
```

If you build from GIT sources and not a released tarball, then remember:

```shell
user@example:~/merecat/> ./autogen.sh
```

To install `httpd` into `/usr/sbin/`, default index and icons into
`/var/www`, and config file to `/etc/merecat.conf`:

```shell
user@example:~/merecat/> ./configure --prefix=/usr --localstatedir=/var --sysconfdir=/etc
user@example:~/merecat/> make
user@example:~/merecat/> sudo make install
```

Features
--------

Merecat consists of a front-end, `merecat.c`, and a standalone HTTP
library, `libhttpd.c`, which can be tweaked in various ways and used
for embedding a web server in another application if needed.

The most common options are available from the `merecat` command line
and the `merecat.conf` configuration file.  Other, less common options,
can be enabled using the `configure` script:

```
--enable-builtin-icons  Enable built-in icons for dir listings
--enable-htaccess       Enable .htaccess files for access control
--enable-htpasswd       Enable .htpasswd files for authentication
--enable-public-html    Enable $HOME/public_html as ~USERNAME/
--enable-msie-padding   Add padding to error messages for Internet Explorer
--disable-dirlisting    Disable directory listings when no index file is found
--without-config        Disable /etc/merecat.conf support using libConfuse
--without-ssl           Disable HTTPS support, default: enabled
--without-symlinks      Disable httpd and in.httpd symlinks to merecat
--without-zlib          Disable mod_deflate (gzip) using zlib
```

The source file `merecat.h` has even more features that can be tweaked,
some of those are mentioned in the man page, but the header file has
very useful comments as well.
